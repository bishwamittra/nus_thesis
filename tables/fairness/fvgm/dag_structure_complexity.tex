		\caption[Ablation study: effect of Bayesian network on {\fvgm}]{Effect of number of variables in the learned Bayesian Network on computation time of {\fvgm}. In both plots, we vary $ \frac{|\mathbf{V}|}{|\nonsensitive \cup \sensitive|} $, that is the ratio between the number of variables in the Bayesian Network to the number of features. We observe that as this ratio increases to $ 1 $, both runtime of {\fvgm} (left plot) and network learning time (right plot) increase. }
