I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who has supported me throughout my PhD. This has been a journey of self-discovery, patience, and continuous effort to surpass myself day by day. I am fortunate to have met amazing researchers around the world, communicating ideas and learning from them. Reflecting on Socrates' famous words, ``Know Thyself'', my PhD has been a journey of understanding my limitations and fostering a mindset of overcoming shortcomings while enjoying the pursuit of knowledge. At this moment, I truly understand that the outcome of my PhD goes beyond the thesis itself; it encompasses my personal growth and development.


I come from a humble background in Bangladesh, where my passion for math, science, and computer science has always been a driving force. Today, I am immensely grateful to announce that my dream of pursuing a PhD in computer science has become a reality. I am deeply thankful to the brilliant minds I have had the privilege to encounter throughout my doctoral journey.

I am immensely grateful to my advisor, Dr. Kuldeep S. Meel, for playing a crucial role in my PhD journey. Under his guidance, I have learned the importance of being an independent researcher and have been provided with numerous opportunities to achieve this goal. I owe my confidence as a researcher to Kuldeep's unwavering support in connecting me with exceptional researchers through conferences, workshops, internships, and research visits. His leadership, passion, and dedication have truly inspired me. I consider myself privileged to have been a part of his research lab and to have experienced the vibrant research culture it offers. I vividly recall the early semesters in NUS, where Kuldeep would spend hours discussing with the research group, creating an environment that fostered growth and learning. As a new PhD student, his supervision boosted my confidence and enabled me to flourish in the doctoral program. Kuldeep's sharp intellect and innovative thinking have not only made me enjoy graduate school but have also facilitated my personal growth. I am grateful for his relentless guidance, which has not only enhanced my skills as a researcher but also shaped me into a better person.

Gummadi, Daniel Neider, Arijit Khan, Jonathan Scarlet, Chandrika Bhardwaj, Vijay Saraswat, Naheed Anjum Arafat, and Lorenzo Ciampiconi are among the remarkable collaborators who have generously shared their knowledge and experience with me.

In addition, I thank Harold Soh and Reza Shokri, who examine my thesis with utmost attention. Their feedback has been a driving force for me to reflect positively on my thesis, building a mindset for a broader view on research in general.
